Tool:    bedtools getfasta (aka fastaFromBed)
Version: v2.25.0
Summary: Extract DNA sequences into a fasta file based on feature coordinates.

Usage:   bedtools getfasta [OPTIONS] -fi <fasta> -bed <bed/gff/vcf> -fo <fasta> 

Options: 
	-fi	Input FASTA file
	-bed	BED/GFF/VCF file of ranges to extract from -fi
	-fo	Output file (can be FASTA or TAB-delimited)
	-name	Use the name field for the FASTA header
	-split	given BED12 fmt., extract and concatenate the sequencesfrom the BED "blocks" (e.g., exons)
	-tab	Write output in TAB delimited format.
		- Default is FASTA format.

	-s	Force strandedness. If the feature occupies the antisense,
		strand, the sequence will be reverse complemented.
		- By default, strand information is ignored.

	-fullHeader	Use full fasta header.
		- By default, only the word before the first space or tab is used.
