## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

mod <- model.matrix(~ factor(tissue) + factor(dpo), colData(dds))
mod
mod0 <- model.matrix(~ factor(pid), colData(coadse.filt))
#Verify wether is full rank --> yes!
is.fullrank(mod)
sv <- sva(assays(coadse.filt)$logCPM, mod, mod0)
modsv <- cbind(mod, sv$sv)
mod0sv <- cbind(mod0, sv$sv)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
